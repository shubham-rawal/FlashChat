# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial was to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter Apps. I used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 


## What I have created...

I have built a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
