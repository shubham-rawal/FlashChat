# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial was to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter Apps. I used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 


## App Demo

I have built a modern one-to-one messaging app where users can sign in and chat!

## What I have learned

Through this project, I was able to brushen up my backend skills and learnt a lot about Firebase and how to work with Authentication and Firestore to implement a safe and secure way to send and receive messages.
It also helped me understand how personal chat apps work and how to use Firestore database to implement the same.
